ðŸ“Œ Objective

Learn and implement tree-based models for classification and regression, understand ensemble learning, and analyze feature importance.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
Python

Scikit-learn

Graphviz / Matplotlib

Pandas & NumPy

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

You can use datasets like:

Heart Disease Dataset


ðŸš€ Steps Implemented

Data Loading & Preprocessing

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Handled missing values & encoded categorical variables

Decision Tree Classifier

Trained using DecisionTreeClassifier from Scikit-learn

Controlled depth to prevent overfitting

Visualized using Graphviz / plot_tree

Random Forest Classifier

Trained using RandomForestClassifier

Compared accuracy with Decision Tree

Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Cross-validation

Feature Importance

Plotted importance scores for interpretability

ðŸ“Š Results

Random Forest generally outperformed a single Decision Tree

Controlled overfitting by tuning max_depth and using ensemble methods

Identified top contributing features for predictions

ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings

Decision Trees are intuitive but prone to overfitting

Random Forests improve stability and accuracy using bagging

Feature importance helps in feature selection and model interpretation
